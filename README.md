# xpseed-zero
Minecraft Mod that makes all table enchantments use the `XpSeed` 0.
This is useful to examine all possible first enchants.

Creating a new world for each possible first enchant in the game (exploiting
bug MC-92803) would be very tedious.
So with this mod every enchantment uses the initial seed and you can
experiment with different items and enchantment levels in any world.
